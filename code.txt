#The above code is not completely wrong and will provide the output, but the change i made was changing the variable name reversed to rev as reversed is an built in function name and as a good practise to not use the function names in naming variables i have changed that. Also i have made the string manipulation case easrier using the sting slicing method in a single statement

#In the improved code the changes were made to line 14 and 15. The updated code catches the sorted subarrays returned by the recursive merge_sort(left) and merge_sort(right) methods. This ensures that the left and right subarrays are correctly sorted.
